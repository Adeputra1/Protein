# Protein
Protein is an Android App for [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). It is fully open sourced but also published on Google Play (coming soon). 
You can discuss how-tos and best practices on creating an Android App around Protein. 

## Highlights
- Material Design: Not a typical Material Design App, but you will find some familiar elements in Protein.
- MVP architecture: Whole project is built on MVP. Views are implemented by custom views and fragments with activity being
pure container.
- RxJava: Model layer supported by RxJava. Also compose activity and fragment's lifecycles.
- Auto Value: Auto valued all the models to gain some benefits.
- Configuration change: Handles configuration changes like a charm.
- Firebase: Firebase Analytics integrated. Only configured for product flavor play.
- Stetho: Better debug.
- Deep link: Showcase deep link mechanism with [ShotActivity](https://github.com/gejiaheng/Protein/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/ge/protein/shot/ShotActivity.java), empowers your native App.
- Test: Yes, a few UI tests. More coming, still working on this.

## Build
### Get Started
```shell
./gradlew installOpenDebug
```

### Attentions
As we are using bleeding edge versions of gradle wrapper and gradle plugin. You may come across some build problems, don't panic, try the followings:
- If you're having aapt error, add `android.enableAapt2=false` to *gradle.properties*.
- If you're having gradle plugin too old error, do as */build.gradle* tells you.
- Use gradlew instead of your local gradle.
- Try to clean project and restart Android Studio.
- If none of the above solve your problem, file an issue.

### Product Flavors
- open: For open source purpose, use this flavor to develop and debug.
- play: For Google Play publish, maintained by Jiaheng Ge (gejiaheng@gmail.com).

### Dribbble OAuth
Dribbble API client id, client secret and client access token for flavor open are placed in *dribbble_config_open.properties*.
The property file for flavor play is not committed to git.  

You may come across API rate limiting according to [Rate Limiting](http://developer.dribbble.com/v1/#rate-limiting). I suggest you 
register a dribbble application [here](http://developer.dribbble.com/) if you want to develop continually. 
As for *Callback URL*, you can use *x-protein-oauth-dribbble://callback* as default. Or you can define your own url, 
and modify relative constants in [ApiConstants.java](https://github.com/gejiaheng/Protein/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/ge/protein/data/api/ApiConstants.java).

## Distribute
Protein is published on Google Play (coming soon). The distribution is maintained by Jiaheng Ge (gejiaheng@gmail.com). 
The [GitHub Contributors page](https://github.com/gejiaheng/Protein/graphs/contributors) will have an entry in the App.
